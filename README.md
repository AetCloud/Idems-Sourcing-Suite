# on-site-md5-hasher
### [Install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sasquire/on-site-md5-hasher/master/main.user.js)
You must have some user script manager. [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en) has a good list.

This user script will add text on some sites that will have the md5sum of images from that site. This text is also a hyperlink to a matching e621 post (if the post exists).

If you find a site that you would like this script to work on, or some other tweak, please send me a message.
